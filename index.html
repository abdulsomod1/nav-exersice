            <span class="bold">Web 1</span> Fast forward 15 years to the year 1989, British computer
            scientist Tim Berner Lee researching at ​​the European Organization for Nuclear
            Research, known as CERN, created a protocol that could link hypertext documents into an
            information system. By October of 1990, Tim wrote 3 fundamental technologies that
            constitute the web even today - HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URI (Uniform Resource
            Identifier), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). After this, Tim wrote the first web
            page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”), and right here, the World Wide Web (WWW) was
            invented. By the end of 1990, the first web page was presented and visible to the world.
            *Important - The Internet and World Wide Web are often mistaken for each other. The
            World Wide Web is a way of accessing information using the internet and the internet is
            the networking infrastructure between nodes or computers. From 1991, the whole
            revolution of the internet to be used by anyone across the world started to grow like
            wildfire. In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international
            community devoted to developing open web standards. New web browsers like Microsoft
            Explorer and Netscape Navigator came that made internet surfing mainstream. The whole
            Web1 movement was powered by regular computers. You could read data on your computer
            ‘boxes’. There were a few thousand web pages created by technically-experienced ‘content
            creators’ and if you would want to download an image or a video from the internet, it
            was taking forever. However, anyone was free to build on it. Clearly, Web1 was
            decentralized, open-source, and slow. It’s open-source nature enabled major corporations
            like Goodle and Amazon to start building their colossal empires, however, things took a
            different turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">web 2</span> The early emergence of Web2 is accredited to the rise of
            commerce on the internet. Companies started to sell goods and services on the internet.
            This massive boom of ‘e-commerce’ platforms led of the early 2000s led to the .dotcom
            bubble. E-commerce platforms made interactions with the website possible. Many
            businesses failed in this debacle although, they laid the foundation for enormous
            possibilities web was capable of.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The Magnificent Rise of Social Media</span> The very first
            possibility that revolutionized the internet era was to make everyone in this world
            capable of creating their own webpage without writing a single line of code. Everyone
            was capable of becoming a content creator and interacting with each other instead of
            only interacting with the website. Platforms like Friendster, Friendfeed, and Myspace
            were developed by the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, California, and users around the
            world were able to share anything they wanted on the internet. For the first time,
            anyone in the world was able to have a social network on the internet. By 2006, we had
            Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, the three current giants of social media and the rest is
            history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Users Became the Products</span> Both e-commerce and social
            networking platforms made their users have two fundamental requirements to interact with
            their platform:
            <ul>
              <li class="bold">An identity to interact on the platform</li>
              <li class="bold">Blind trust on the platforms</li>
            </ul>
            Web2 began the era of centralized technologies and data storage centers where an
            enormous amount of data started to be stored in a few warehouses owned by a few giants.
            Censorship, surveillance, and practices like deplatforming were standardized for
            disagreeing with the platform’s terms and conditions. These giants were, and are still
            able to, influence the data shared with the users, use it effectively to place ads for
            their advertisers or sell it to other companies to improve their products and their
            placements. Users’ own data is no more in their own control. Data has now become an
            asset that is continuing to make the giants richer
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Identity and Ownership</span> In Web2, you have numerous digital
            identities on a myriad of platforms. Most of them are connected to a single account that
            can be your email id. When you sign up using your Gmail on any website, your email
            account becomes a point of contact as well as a source of your digital footprint that
            records each and every online activity connected to your account. The most important
            question of this whole centralized shift again arises: Do you control what you can do
            with this data and who you can share it with? In simple words, do you completely ‘own’
            and ‘control’” your digital footprint? Over the years, we have seen data breaches
            consistently proving that the new Internet or Web2 has failed to protect user privacy.
            Global regulations like GDPR are not proving to be enough to protect users’ rights.
            Billions of dollars have been lost and spent to give the current users of Web2 this one
            fundamental right they rightfully deserve. The debates around data and digital identity
            to be self-sovereign and privacy-preserved began and this whole movement started to take
            a new shape - Web3.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Web3 Explained</span> Web3 is the next evolution of a
            blockchain-based Word Wide Web that is decentralized, democratized, and more
            interactive. With the help of blockchain, developers will be able to build websites,
            platforms, and applications that are more secure, privacy-preserved, and
            censorship-resistant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">The Origins of Web3</span> The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was
            coined by Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama, in 2014. By
            bringing a group of friends, developers, and pioneering entrepreneurs in the blockchain
            space together, in 2017, Gavin Wood also set up Web3 Foundation, an organization that
            rewards grants to innovative projects that are building decentralized web applications
            and protocols. The whole Web3 movement gained tremendous popularity as the popularity of
            blockchain protocols and its products like NFTs, tokens, and Metaverse grew. The
            movement is joined by the Ethereum Foundation, Mozilla, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
            Dock, and many more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold"
              >Has Web3 Transitioned from AI-based to Blockchain-Based? The Role of Blockchain</span
            >
            The definition that was describing Web3 evolved over time and due to the popularity of
            blockchain since the invention of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it was no longer limited to a
            ‘smart internet’. Tim Berner Lee proposed the first concept of Web 3.0 in 2006 which is
            different from the meaning it has obtained today. He thought ‘Semantic Web’ driven by
            emerging technologies like AI and Machine Learning are going to play a pivotal role in
            this evolution. The goal of this Web extension was to make data machines readable. His
            vision was to make the internet more dynamic, open-source, interactive, and intelligent.
            Was it the shift in the popularity of technologies or the shift in the paradigm, Web3
            (Gavin Wood’s iteration) became more popular than Web3.0 (Tim Berner Lee’s interaction),
            and now, in all the definitions across the Google searches, Web3 is defined as a form of
            ‘decentralized internet’. The primary objective Web3 is now focusing upon is users
            should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only
            when they choose to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Web3 - More Than Crypto</span> Web3 has often been mistaken for
            cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It is true that in the future, they may form a crucial
            component of Web3. But to limit the scope of Web3 to only tokens and NFTs will be an
            understatement of this vast technology. Since Web3 is based on blockchain technology, we
            will need tokens to facilitate transactions between 2 users. For any type of content
            (art, text, image, audio, or video) to have value, they will be needed to convert into
            NFTs and then transacted for a price agreed between the buyer and seller. Adding to
            this, Web3 will have numerous incentive and reward mechanisms for user participation,
            governance, and other technical and non-technical operations. However, cryptocurrencies
            and NFTs constitute only a small part of Web3. Web3 encompasses an extensive range of
            sectors, industries, and applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">What Makes Web3 Important? Ownership</span> Ownership of data is the
            core objective of the Web3. This means users will be able to grant, revoke or modify
            access to their data anytime. This also means users will no longer need to disclose each
            and every data related to their online digital identity. Users will have features like
            ‘selective disclosures’ using which they will be able to disclose only the portion of
            their information that is requested by a third party. Web3 repairs the deepest damage
            caused by Web2 on the idea of Web. Blockchain-based sign-in systems like Web3 ID become
            all the more more essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that
            gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Decentralization</span> Web3 is going to be powered by blockchain and
            tokenized assets (cryptocurrencies and NFTs). Decentralized technologies will enable
            peer-to-peer interactions between individuals, witnessed and verified by a decentralized
            network of nodes. The P2P and decentralized capabilities of blockchain and Web3
            fundamentally change the Web2 data infrastructure. Blockchain has the capability to
            decentralize storage, governance, and data authentication. Public blockchain
            infrastructures are open-source, permissionless, and trustless. With no single point of
            failure and a global community participating in the ecosystem at different levels, Web3
            is more secure, dynamic, and interactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Reputation</span> All the content, texts, audio, images, or videos
            will be created with a cryptographic signature signed by the public key of the user.
            Every content will have the stamp of its creator. There can be a voting mechanism to
            review the content. Reviewers can be rewarded for their reviews and creators can be
            rewarded based on the impressions and response on their content. In Web3, users will
            carry a reputation based on the content they have created and reviewed. A
            reputation-based system will influence users to stay honest in the ecosystem and produce
            good-quality content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Identity</span> A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are
            online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists
            online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like
            passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. On the web, it can be your emails, user
            names, and passwords, social media profiles, platform accounts, etc. Web3 is going to
            change how your digital identity is created, authenticated, and linked to your online
            activity. Subsequent to this, Web3 authentication systems like Web3 ID (by Dock) let
            users or owners of the IDs to control the data linked to their digital IDs. With the
            help of Web3 ID, how you will be able to authenticate your identity and sign in to
            websites and platforms is going to completely change. See more details here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Security and Privacy</span> Web3 is capable of leveraging the most
            powerful features of blockchain to secure data breaches and user privacy. Each asset,
            financial transaction, or message can be encrypted using cryptographic algorithms.
            Encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling its contents so only
            certain people (with a key than can decrypt)can look at your message. Asymmetric
            encryption or Public-private key cryptography can be used to encrypt our online activity
            and make it secure and tamper-proof. Asymmetric encryption is when the encryption key
            (also called the public key) and the corresponding decryption key (also called the
            private key) are different. No data is stored on the blockchain. Blockchain only
            maintains an online register of all the identities created on it. Blockchain also
            maintains the proof of verification of all online transactions. Zero-knowledge Proofs
            (ZKPs) can be deployed to provide extra layers of security for data authentication,
            verification, and disclosures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Censorship Resistance</span> The ability to censor content, webpages,
            apps, websites or users is a power that comes with tremendous responsibility. There will
            be no corporate censorship. User data is no longer controlled however, decentralized
            voting mechanisms can be in place with the help of governance tokens whether to continue
            keeping the content on the web or burn it. Interoperability of platforms will allow
            users to migrate content from one platform to another if the content is negative or does
            not contribute to the platform’s nature.
